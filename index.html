                x-proto is an online platform that aims to build and support a decentralized community of artists and like-minded people. We seek to amplify art and ideas that do not have an immediate place in our contemporary creative economy. We want this platform to foster connectivity and empathy across a global network. <br><br>

            The initial form of this project concentrates on live streaming. Adapting to new forms of broadcasting and digital spaces is important to our mission and we hope to grow into other technologies in the near future.<br><br>

            <div class="panel">
              <p class="schedule_txt">Active since 2007, Jesse Osborne-Lanthier is a Montréal-based multidisciplinary artist, designer, producer, sound-engineer, curator and musician. His interest lies in using his work to create both a living ecosystem of abstract memories and outward-looking, physically-reactive music to shock, appall, and delight his audiences in equal measure. His last several releases have found homes on Halcyon Veil, raster-noton, Where To Now?, United Standard, and now, Italy’s Haunter Records.<br><br>

Musically, Osborne-Lanthier looks to the material composition techniques of grime, rap, modern classical, sound art, heavy metal, and more, to create something that is readily unique and oddly accessible in its singularity. Above all, Osborne-Lanthier maintains a taste for intensity as a tool for immersive engagement. His music is tactile and elastic, morphing rapidly from uncanny-valley EDM tropes to vast, sweeping expanses of sincere choral synths. His work provides stark contrasts at every turn; sometimes heavily structured or freely fluid; symphonic or dissonant; minimal or intricate.<br><br>

Osborne-Lanthier’s hybridized musical languages gesture at both something plainly known and deeply unknowable; the new, the old, the imaginary, and the unimaginable jostling side-by-side for equal attention in the ears of his audience. His work operates as a catalogue of his various moods, political beliefs, and interests; a constantly updating self-referential corpus. As his design practice grows in both scope and confidence, so too does the visual identity that accompanies his music.<br>

In addition to his solo work, Osborne-Lanthier is a prolific collaborator; most notably under the aliases ACABRBMA (with Varg) and Femminielli Noir (with Bernadino Femminielli and Asaël Robitaille), and with Grischa Lichtenberger and Daniele Guerrini (AKA Heith). As a designer and engineer he’s provided artwork, design, and mixing & mastering services to literally hundreds of artists and labels — including scene luminaries like  NON Records, Halcyon Veil, Where To Now?, DFA Records, Alex Zhang Hungtai, MSYLMA, rkss, and countless more. He is the co-founder of H Studios, a Montréal-based multimedia design studio, and Bunni Groupe, an artist’s advocacy collective. 2020 will see him launch his long-planned label Appærent Éditions with Pierre Guerineau (AKA Feu St-Antoine and 1/2 of Essaie Pas) and Will Ballantyne (AKA City and a member of Vancouver’s s.M.i.L.e. collective), as well as contribute his production talents to Marie Davidson’s upcoming LP.<br>

He has toured extensively in America, Asia, and Europe, performing at festivals such as Mutek, Elektra, Norberg, Sonar, Rewire, Lunchmeat, CTM, Synthposium Armenia, Suoni Per Il Popolo and FASMA. His audio and visual works have also been featured in museums, galleries, and venues such as the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, The Nottingham Contemporary Museum, National Gallery of Canada, Compufunk, Berghain, NK, WWWß Tokyo, La Petite Mort, Club Stomp Osaka, Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival CZ, São Paulo Museum of Image and Sound, NK Berlin, and EMS Studio Stockholm.</p>
